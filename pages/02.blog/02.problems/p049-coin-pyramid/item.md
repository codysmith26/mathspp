Can you make the pyramid point the other way by moving only three coins?

# Problem statement

The image above shows a pyramid composed of 10 coins:
4 coins, then 3, then 2, then 1.

Your task is to make the pyramid point the other way by moving
_only_ three coins.

In the image above, that means you want the pyramid to be pointing to the left.

With a figure, if the initial pyramid is

```txt
O O O O
 O O O
  O O
   O
```

you have to make it look like

```txt
   O
  O O 
 O O O
O O O O
```

Again, only moving 3 coins.

The purpose of the puzzle is not for you to find a loophole in the instructions.

!!! Give it some thought!
